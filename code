Also, all the richest people in Chefland are not planning to grow and maintain their current worth.

To be the richest person in Chefland, he needs to be worth at least BB billion dollars. How many years will it take Chef to reach his goal if his value increases by XX billion dollars each year?

InputThe first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, three integers AA, BB, XX.
OutputFor each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.

SOLUTION

for i in range(int(input())):
    a,b,x=map(int,input().split())
    year=int((b-a)/x)
    print(year)
